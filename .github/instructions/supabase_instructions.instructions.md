When doing changes for the React application, take note of the structure of the Supabase integration in `supabase/`. The project uses Supabase for authentication and database management, so ensure that any modifications maintain compatibility with Supabase's services. Additionally, make sure the UI of the responses align with the schema defined in the Supabase database to ensure data consistency and integrity.

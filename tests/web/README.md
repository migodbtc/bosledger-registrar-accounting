web tests (unit & component)

Recommendations:

- Use Vitest (integrates with Vite) + @testing-library/react
- Place unit tests under tests/web/unit and component tests under tests/web/components

Placeholder example files:

- utils.test.ts — unit test for repo utilities
- sample.test.tsx — example component test

Run via the project's `web/package.json` scripts (add `vitest` as needed).
